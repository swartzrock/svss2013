Increasingly, Spark is also being used to power a stack of higher-level computing tools, including Shark, a port of the Hive SQL engine, Spark Streaming, a stream processing engine, and GraphX, a graph computing package that can describe algorithms like PageRank in a few lines of code. We'll show how Spark's Scala API allows these types of computations to be seamlessly composed.

To really drive my point home, I'll show how it integrates with other language features, such as pattern matching, implicit classes, and macros.

              The hidden agenda of this talk is to illustrate why we say Scala is simple, which is not to be confused with 'easy or 'simplistic', as previously expertly explained by Rich Hickey. I'll show how string interpolation is simple in the sense that it can be understood in terms of Scala's core concepts: methods and objects -- nothing more. Thus, it adds expressive power to Scala without the cost of introducing new concepts, which is where true complexity lies. 

              In fact, all of Scala is designed with this philosophy: implementing sophisticated solutions to complex problems in a simple, elegant, way. Elegance may be in the eye of the beholder, but I'd say simplicity isn't. (Also, no one said it was going to be easy -- would you want it to?)

              If that wasn't enough, I'll take you on a brief tour of Scala 2.10 and update you on where we are with Scala 2.11.">

              IT Operations Management has increasingly become a big data problem. The major driver for this is wide adoption of system virtualization which creates a unifying measurement layer across hardware vendors. The result is an explosion in the number of instrumentation points in today’s IT systems.
              At CloudPhysics, our mission is to use the world’s machine data to take the guesswork out of operations management. 
              We do this by deriving collective intelligence from the continuous machine data sent to us by our customers across the globe. We model how systems will perform by simulating different configurations and analyzing the hidden relationships within them to map the complexities and nuances of IT systems. This allows us to customize big data insights to a specific infrastructure thereby helping drive radical improvements in IT operations.
              Our back-end data infrastructure and analysis framework handle both semi-structured configuration data and time-series performance data. Cross-user analysis of collected data reveals common patterns in system configuration settings and performance trends. The results enable our users to benchmark against and learn from their peers.

The system is designed specifically for trivially parallelizable graph algorithms (which most algorithms I've run in the lab are).

Similar in nature to .NET's LINQ API, Slick is a successor to the popular ScalaQuery library. With Slick, database queries can be expressed using Scala code – which is composable and more convenient than Java APIs like JPA, and safer than string-based query languages like SQL.

              With a compile-time check to ensure type-safety, Slick queries allow users to interact with their database without knowing SQL, instead using function calls that fit naturally into their programming model. In this talk we'll explore some of these functions and the functional programming model used; concepts such as map, flatMap, and group methods – and how we we can use them to query a database like an in-memory collection.  If necessary, Slick users can call custom stored procedures and even fall back to raw SQL statements for cases where the Slick API won't map to a database feature.

              Slick currently offers support for many leading Relational Databases, including Microsoft's SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. The Slick team is working on extending support for custom datasources, such as NoSQL datastores like MongoDB.">
